# find-job-app

This is an employment application written in Python and postgreSql. The application can be used by those who are seeking a job and those who are looking for an employee.

To run the application, you must first create a postgreSql server and change fields such as username and password in the file named Helper.py. 

Afterwards, you need to create the tables by running the file named db.sql once in the database system. Tables are filled with sample data in the db.sql file. If you do not want to add this data, you can delete it.
